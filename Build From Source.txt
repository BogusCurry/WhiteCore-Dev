Building your own from source
=============================

The main development repository is at https://github.com/WhiteCoreSim/WhiteCore-Dev.git
Release packages at https://github.com/WhiteCoreSim/WhiteCore-Dev/releases

Prerequisites
=============
Mono V3.x    : Checkout http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html for the latest update
				Mono 2.8.10 available with Ubuntu variations will also work
(Optional)  Xamarin Studio for a nice IDE : Checkout http://http://monodevelop.com/Download

Building
========
Cd the the downloaded directory.

*nix (inc Mac)
--------------
Run(Execute) the  ./runprebuild.sh file to create the required c# solution files.

Compile WhiteCore :
#:  xbuild WhiteCore.sln

Windows
-------
Run(Execute) the  'runprebuild.bat' batch file.  This will ask several questions 
with the option to build at the end.


A large amount of compile information will be shown but when completed, 
no errors should be indicated.
NOTE:  Some warnings may be shown (36 at last count) but these do not present 
any problem or prevent operation of the servers. 
(These will be corrected and removed as time permits)

When completed the 'WhiteCoreSim/bin' subdirectory will contain the newly compiled WhiteCore files.

Running for the first time
--------
If you are not running this for the first time and already have a configured WhiteCore installation, skip
to the next section.

Create a WhiteCore installation direction, for example with the following on Un*x systems (inc. Mac OS X):

    mkdir ../WhiteCode-Install

Copy the 'bin','Config', and 'Data' subdirectories into this new directory, for example with the following
on Un*x systems (inc. Mac OS X):

    cp -r WhiteCoreSim/bin ../WhiteCore-Install/
    cp -r WhiteCoreSim/Config ../WhiteCore-Install/
    cp -r WhiteCoreSim/Data ../WhiteCore-Install/

Change to the 'bin' subdirectory under the WhiteCore installation directory, and start WhiteCore.

Answer yes when asked if you want to auto-configure.

Updating an existing WhiteCode installation
---------
Copy the 'bin' subdirectory to your existing WhiteCore installation, replacing the 'bin' directory there.

Restart as per normal using the appropriate script file.
Answer 'No' if asked to re-configure at startup.

Checkout the ReadMe.txt file for the rest
